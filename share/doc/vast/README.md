## Key Features

- **High-Throughput Ingestion**: import numerous log formats over 100k
  events/second, including [Zeek](https://www.zeek.org/),
  [Suricata](https://suricata-ids.org/), JSON, and CSV.

- **Low-Latency Queries**: sub-second response times over the entire data lake,
  thanks to multi-level bitmap indexing and actor model concurrency.
  Particularly helpful for instant indicator checking over the entire dataset.

- **Flexible Export**: access data in common text formats (ASCII, JSON, CSV), in
  binary form (MRT, PCAP), or via zero-copy relay through [Apache
  Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) for arbitrary downstream analysis.

- **Powerful Data Model and Query Language**: the generic semi-structured data
  model allows for expressing complex data in a typed fashion. An intuitive
  query language that feels like grep and awk at scale enables powerful
  subsetting of data with domain-specific operations, such as top-*k* prefix
  search for IP addresses and subset relationships.

- **Schema Pivoting**: the missing link to navigate between related events,
  e.g., extracting a PCAP for a given IDS alert, or locating all related logs
  for a given query.

## Get VAST

Linux users can download our [latest static binary
release](https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-public-data/vast-static-builds/vast-static-latest.tar.gz)
via browser or cURL.

```sh
curl -L -O https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-public-data/vast-static-builds/vast-static-latest.tar.gz
```

Unpack the archive. It contains three folders `bin`, `etc`, and `share`. To get
started invoke the binary in the `bin` directory directly.

```sh
tar xfz vast-static-latest.tar.gz
bin/vast --help
```

To install VAST properly for your local user simly place the unpacked folders in
`/usr/local/`.

FreeBSD and macOS users have to build from source. Clone the `master` branch to
get the most recent version of VAST.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tenzir/vast
```

Once you have all dependencies in place, build VAST with the following commands:

```sh
./configure
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target test
cmake --build build --target integration
cmake --build build --target install
```

The [installation guide][installation-url] contains more detailed and
platform-specific instructions on how to build and install VAST.

## Getting Started

Here are some commands to get a first glimpse of what VAST can do for you.

**Start a VAST node**:

```sh
vast start
```

**Ingest [Zeek](http://www.zeek.org) logs of various kinds**:

```sh
zcat *.log.gz | vast import zeek
```

**Run a query over the last hour, rendered as JSON**:

```sh
vast export json '#timestamp > 1 hour ago && (6.6.6.6 || 5353/udp)'
```

**Ingest a [PCAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcap) trace with a 1024-byte
flow cutoff**:

```sh
vast import pcap -c 1024 < trace.pcap
```

**Run a query over PCAP data, sort the packets by time, and feed them into**
`tcpdump`:

```sh
vast export pcap "sport > 60000/tcp && src !in 10.0.0.0/8" \
  | ipsumdump --collate -w - \
  | tcpdump -r - -nl
```
