Description: network telemetry engine for data-driven security investigations
 VAST is a distributed platform for high-performance network forensics and
 incident response that provides both continuous ingestion of voluminous event
 streams and interactive query performance.
 VAST leverages a native implementation of the actor model to scale both
 intra-machine across available CPU cores, and inter-machine over a cluster of
 commodity systems.
